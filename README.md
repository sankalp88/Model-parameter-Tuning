Evaluation of parameters in Machine learning model with Grid search

For evaluating various Machine learning algorithms, we first need an evaluation methodology, which will determine how
data is split into train/test parts. we can use either of the following:
- random train/test split for a minimum of 5 times OR
- k-fold cross validation with value of k greater than or equal to 5
For evaluation metrics, we need to output as many of the following as possible:
- confusion matrix for all classes
- accuracy measure
- classification report
- area under ROC curve
- ROC plot
